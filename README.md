# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built using **Next.js**, **ShadeCN**, and **EmailJS**. It showcases my skills, projects, and provides a contact form for visitors to reach out to me.

## Features

- **Next.js**: A powerful React framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) and statically generated web applications.
- **ShadeCN**: A modern design system used for styling components and ensuring a clean, user-friendly UI.
- **EmailJS**: Used for handling contact form submissions without the need for a backend server.
